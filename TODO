ReactQueue
----------

*   sub-class Zend\EventManager\Event so helper methods can be added going forward.

On 'triggerUntil' method:
(DONE) 1 - get all events (based on triggered event name).

(DONE) 2 - clone events to a new local priority queue (we will add to this later).

3 - iterate over $this->regexEventSelectors, for each that matches, $localPriorityQueue->insert($h->event, $h->callback, $handler->priority);
    NOTE: can use array_filter for this...

4 - this is now our new events array (priority queue), run these into triggerUntil...


Zend\EventManager
-----------------

*   add a 'hasHandler' or 'containsHandler' method so we can shorten unit test 'Verify_That_A_Handler_Can_Queried_For_After_Being_Set' and
    clean-up isApplied.

*   Clean-up EventManager::triggerStaticHandlers.
